You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

You are a function calling AI model. You are provided with function signatures within <tools> </tools> XML tags. You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query. Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Here are the available tools: <tools> [{"name": "calculate_age", "description": "Calculates the age based on the birthdate.", "parameters": {"birthdate": {"description": "The birthdate in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.", "type": "str"}}}, {"name": "find_duplicate_number", "description": "Finds the duplicate number in a list of integers.", "parameters": {"nums": {"description": "The list of integers.", "type": "List[int]"}}}, {"name": "word_frequency", "description": "Calculates the frequency of each word in a text.", "parameters": {"text": {"description": "The input text.", "type": "str"}}}, {"name": "reverse_words", "description": "Reverses the order of words in a sentence.", "parameters": {"sentence": {"description": "The input sentence.", "type": "str"}}}] </tools> Use the following pydantic model JSON schema for each tool call you will make: {'properties': {'arguments': {'title': 'Arguments', 'type': 'object'}, 'name': {'title': 'Name', 'type':'string'}},'required': ['arguments', 'name'], 'title': 'FunctionCall', 'type': 'object'} For each function call return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call> </tool_call> XML tags as follows:

What is the word frequency of 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'? And can you reverse the words in the sentence 'Hello world this is a test'?

<|assistant|>
<think>
Okay, the user has two separate questions here. The first is to find the word frequency of the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". The second is to reverse the words in the sentence "Hello world this is a test". Let me break down each part step by step.

Starting with the word frequency: I need to use the word_frequency tool. The input text is given as a string, so I'll pass that into the tool. That should return a dictionary where each key is a word and the value is its frequency.

Next, the reverse the sentence part. The user wants the words reversed. That's a straightforward reverse of words in the sentence. The reverse_words tool should handle this. The sentence is "Hello world this is a test", so I'll pass that into the reverse_words function, which will return the sentence with words reversed.

So I need to make two separate function calls: one for word_frequency and another for reverse_words. I'll use the word_frequency tool with the sentence as the text parameter, and reverse_words with the same sentence. The outputs from each tool will be returned as JSON objects.

Search for 'laptops' on Tmall and retrieve the second page of results.

<|assistant|>
<think>
Okay, the user wants to search for 'laptops' on Tmall and retrieve the second page of results. Let's think about how to do this.

First, the available functions are listed. The tmall_search_by_keyword function seems suitable here. Looking at its parameters, I need to provide the page number and the keyword. The keyword here is 'laptops', and the page is the second one, so page=2.

So the function call should use tmall_search_by_keyword with page=2 and keyword='laptops'. That should give the results for the second page.

Wait, does the function return the correct data structure? The user might want the product details, like names, prices, maybe images. The documentation says tmall_search_by_keyword returns a list of products, each with title, price, picture, and other details. So yes, this should work.

I would like to extract details from a LinkedIn company page. Could you assist me in fetching the information from this URL: https://www.linkedin.com/company/abc-corporation?

<|assistant|>
<think>
Okay, the user wants to extract details from a LinkedIn company page. The URL provided is https://www.linkedin.com/company/company-name. I need to use the extract tool to get this done. The extract tool has a parameter for the URL and an optional HTML flag. Since the user didn't specify any other parameters, I'll just provide the URL.

Wait, the URL passed is a company page, so the extract function should handle that. The result will include things like the company's name, industry, employees, headquarters, etc. The user didn't mention any specific details to extract, so I should just go with the default extraction. The HTML flag is set to true by default, but since they might want the raw data, I should include it in the parameters. But the documentation says it's optional. The extract tool should handle the data extraction from the company page.

Could you share some motivational quotes that might inspire my team during this business project?

The user wants motivational quotes to inspire their team during a business project. I should use the get_all_motivational_quotes tool to fetch some. Since they didn't specify a language, I'll use the default, maybe English. Also, no parameters for skip or limit were given, so using the default pagination.
